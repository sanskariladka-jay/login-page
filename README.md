# login-page

Great! If you’ve already created a login page and want to enhance it, here are some extra points or features you could consider adding:

# Input Validation:
Client-Side Validation: Ensure that the email/username and password inputs are not empty or improperly formatted (e.g., email format, password length).
Password Strength Indicator: Provide feedback on password strength (weak, medium, strong).
# Error Handling:
Display specific error messages (e.g., "Invalid username or password") to help the user understand what went wrong.
3. Remember Me Option:
Implement a “Remember Me” checkbox to keep the user logged in across sessions using cookies or local storage.
